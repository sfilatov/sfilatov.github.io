Hi.

I'm **Stepan Filatov** software engineer and geek. 
I live in beautiful city **Prague** with my family.
I'm curious about programming, modern technologies, languages, frameworks.

Currently employed by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) where I'm helping to make [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/home) best SaaS for businesses. One of the projects I'm working on is [Customer Insights](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-insights)

Previously I was working at [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) in core infrastructure engineering. Following the massive transition to modern cloud services, our team built completely new global scale platform for [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) and [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). It serves photos, videos, files, URL previews and emoticons sent by users in chats. 

Before that, I have been frontend developer and built a number of projects using modern open source software stack: Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Javascript/CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, Postgres, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Chef.

I have started my career as Java software developer. I worked with lovely Hibernate, Spring, Tomcat, Groovy, Android. I was long time Android and JVM stack fan until I jumped to Ruby on Rails world.

If you have interesting project ideas ping [me](mailto:filatov.st@gmail.com).
